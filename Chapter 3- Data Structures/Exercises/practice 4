#4. Assume the lists numbers1 has 100 elements and numbers2 is an empty list. Write code that
#copies the values in numbers to numbers2.

numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, ...]  # Assume numbers1 has 100 elements
numbers2 = []  # Initialize an empty list numbers2

for num in numbers1:
    numbers2.append(num)  # Append each element from numbers1 to numbers2

# At this point, numbers2 will contain the same values as numbers1
