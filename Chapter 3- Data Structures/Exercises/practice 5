#5. You have given a Python list. Write a program to find value 20 in the list, and if it is present,
#replace it with 200. Only update the first occurrence of an item.
#Work with the given list:
#list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]


list1 = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 20]

# Find the index of the first occurrence of 20 in the list
index_20 = list1.index(20) if 20 in list1 else -1

if index_20 != -1:
    # Replace the first occurrence of 20 with 200
    list1[index_20] = 200

print(list1)
