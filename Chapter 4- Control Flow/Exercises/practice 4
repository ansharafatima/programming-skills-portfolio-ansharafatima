#4. Write a python program with an if-else statement that displays Speed is normal if the speed
#variable is within the range of 24 to 56. If the speed variable's value is outside this range, display
#'Speed is abnormal

speed = 40  # Replace with your value for speed

if 24 <= speed <= 56:
    print("Speed is normal")
else:
    print("Speed is abnormal")
