#1. Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the
#variable z if the variable a is greater than 100.

# Assuming 'a' is the variable name
# Assigning some value to 'a' for demonstration purposes
a = 120

if a > 100:
    y = 20
    z = 40
    print("Variable 'a' is greater than 100")
    print("y =", y)
    print("z =", z)
else:
    print("Variable 'a' is not greater than 100")
