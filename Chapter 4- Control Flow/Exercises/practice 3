#3. Write a python program with nested decision structures that perform the following: If amount1
#is greater than 10 and amount2 is less than 100, display the greater of amount1 and amount2

amount1 = 15  # Replace with your value for amount1
amount2 = 80  # Replace with your value for amount2

if amount1 > 10:
    if amount2 < 100:
        if amount1 > amount2:
            print("The greater value between amount1 and amount2 is:", amount1)
        elif amount2 > amount1:
            print("The greater value between amount1 and amount2 is:", amount2)
        else:
            print("Both amount1 and amount2 are equal:", amount1)
    else:
        print("amount2 is not less than 100")
else:
    print("amount1 is not greater than 10")
